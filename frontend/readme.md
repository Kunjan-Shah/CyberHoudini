# Getting Started with Create React App

This folder contains the code of frontend for Cyber-houdini event conducted by MLSA in APOGEE 2021.
Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is entirely based on
ReactJS framework.

## Preview of design theme

The colours in final deployed version would not be the same. Once core functioning is finished, design and responsiveness would follow.

## Design stages' Blueprint

- Website design should move from mobile to desktop priority
- Colours and fonts must follow the [MLSA style guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a06ADXfAv7VzuBI0ArgIomQcxoWW21Dm)
- The colour scheme should be made such that it can be easily replaced whenever needed in future. Create a theme.js file that stores all colour information. The entire code fetches theme info from this global file.

## Setting up the dev environment

- to start the frontend lite-development mode, use the command in frontend folder 

  >yarn start
  
  open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
